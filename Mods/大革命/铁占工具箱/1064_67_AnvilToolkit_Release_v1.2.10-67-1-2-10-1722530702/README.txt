AnvilToolkit
This program is a collection of tools with the aim of making new modifications possible and making already possible modifications easier to create. 

The tool is under constant development, with new features and file support being worked on. In the future many more files will be supported and easily editable.

Unpacking and repacking .forge and .data files:
To unpack/repack a .forge or a .data file, simply select it in the game explorer and either click on the available options on the right hand side of the tool or right click the file and select the desired option. Unpacking can also be done by double clicking the .forge/.data file.

Editing textures:
To open the texture viewer, double click the texture file. Once the window has loaded, you can either save the texture as a JPG, PNG, DDS or TGA image or you can replace the texture with a new one. It is recommended to use the DDS format for replacing textures, as that gives you more control over the texture parameters.

If you need any help using the toolkit or you want to keep up to date with all the changes and improvements, you can join the AnvilToolkit discord server here: https://discord.gg/vsuGFEapdq
